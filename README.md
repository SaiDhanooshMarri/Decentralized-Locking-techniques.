Decentralized Locking
• Used multiprocessing to implement decentralized locking.
• Processes chose to get a lock, which required a majority consensus.
• Executes file actions while the lock is active, updating a shared file.
• The application tracked the number of attempts required to get to the file and compared efficiency.
